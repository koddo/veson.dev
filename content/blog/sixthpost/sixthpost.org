#+title: Example Org Mode Title
#+date: <2023-07-17 Mon>
#+tags: tag one, tag two, tag three

This org-mode src block has been run and has results.

#+name: my-bash-block
#+begin_src bash :wrap example
echo hello
#+end_src

Results:

#+RESULTS: my-bash-block
#+begin_example
hello
#+end_example

Another src block, now in elisp. 

#+name: my-elisp-block
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :wrap example :exports both
(message "Hello, World!")
#+END_SRC

Output:

#+results: my-elisp-block
#+begin_example
Hello, World!
#+end_example

Source blocks without specified language get rendered as a quote, which is undesirable. Just let it be an src block of text-mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
just some text
#+END_SRC

Here's not an src, but an example block, looks exacly the same:

#+begin_example
example text
#+end_example

Here's an awesome possum.

#+CAPTION: awesome possum
[[file:possum.png]]

And here's a table. It gets rendered without borders in this template even in markdown for some reason. But that's easy to fix in css.

| Header  1 | Header  2 |
|-----------+-----------|
| Cell  1   | Cell  2   |
| Cell  3   | Cell  4   |
