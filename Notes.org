** Converting org to html

I want to generate html from org, the body only, to insert contents into templates.
 
I was looking for a way to use command line args in elisp, which is not hard, but I somehow didn't think about stdin, and luckily I stumbled upon this snippet while searching for info on the ~org-html-export-as-html~ function:
https://gnu.support/gnu-emacs/emacs-lisp/Emacs-Lisp-emacs-org-to-html-el-on-command-line-convert-your-Org-files-on-command-line-to-HTML-output.html

This is going to be slow, but it's a tiny blog anyway.

$ cat test-page.org | ./build.el
...
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
text
</p>
</div>
...
</div>
